# CSS Exercise #3

This exercise is grouping selectors for multiple class or ID attributes to write non-repetitive HTML and CSS. Here, we give two elements a unique class name, add rules for styles they share, and their own unique styles.

The properties we need to each element are:-
1. The first element: a black background, white text color, and a bold font weight
2. The second element: a yellow background
3. Both elements: a font size of 28px and a list of fonts containing Helvetica and Times New Roman, with sans-serif as a fallback
