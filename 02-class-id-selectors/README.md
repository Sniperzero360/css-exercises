# CSS Exercise #2

This exercise works on understanding how to add class and ID attributes to HTML elements and their respective selectors. Here, we add either class or ID attributes to elements in the problem file, and their style rules in a CSS file.

Similarly styled elements belong in class attributes, while uniquely styled elements belong in ID attributes. There may be elements which only slightly vary from others that belong in multiple classes.

For this exercise, the properties we need to add to each element are:-
1. All odd numbered elements: a light red/pink background, and a list of fonts containing Verdana and DejaVu Sans with sans-serif as a fallback
2. The second element: blue text and a font size of 36px
3. The third element: in addition to the styles for all odd numbered elements, add a font size of 24px
4. The fourth element: a light green background, a font size of 24px, and bold
