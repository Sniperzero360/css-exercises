# CSS Exercise #4

This exercise is to practice chaining different selectors rather than just adding attributes. There are 2 images to style with two class names each, and a single shared class name. We will chain the selectors for both elements, so that each has a unique style, while also having a shared class selector.

The properties we need to add to each element are:
1. Make the element with both the avatar and proportioned classes 300 pixels wide, then give it a height so that it retains its original square proportions (don't hardcode in a pixel value for the height!).
2. Make the element with both the avatar and distorted classes 200 pixels wide, then make its height twice as big as its width (here you should hardcode in a pixel value).
