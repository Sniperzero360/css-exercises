        This is the inline method of adding style declarations directly to HTML elements.
        No selectors are used here as styles are added to the div tag.
        This method is generally only decent for adding a unique style to a single element.
            - It can make it messy
            - Many repetitions can bloat file
            - Inline CSS overrides external and internal CSS methods
