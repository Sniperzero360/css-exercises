# CSS Exercise #1

This exercise builds familiarity with the 3 major CSS methods.

1. External CSS
2. Internal CSS
3. Inline CSS

We only use type selectors while adding styles via the external and internal methods for this exercise.

The properties we add to each element are:

1. div: a red background, white text, a font size of 32px, center aligned, and bold
2. p: a green background, white text, and a font size of 18px
3. button: an orange background and a font size of 18px
